## Part 1 - 
### About

### Implementation



### Execution

```bash
$ ./gccfind.sh [path_to_directory] [word_to_search] [-r]
```
where the path_to_directory is the directory you want to search in, the word_to_search is the word or pattern you want to find, and the "-r" flag indicates whether to search recursively or not.

I put an example command and a test folder for the script

```bash
$ ./gccfind.sh testfolder word -r
```
